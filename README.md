This software allows you to manage the WineHQ start menu on GNU/Linux and also on WineHQ.

On one side, we have our menu stored in “wine/programs” with the added applications, and we can move it to “Start/All Programs,” for example.

We can move the “Office 2003” submenu contained in “wine/programs” to “Start/All Programs.”
 
There is only the graphical interface for now, but your contributions would be welcome.

Any translation possibilities would be appreciated.
